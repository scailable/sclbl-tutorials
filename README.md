## Blog posts:
In our blog posts we explain the usare of the Scailable platform and various details. Posts are created to provide more background regarding our technology.

* [Efficient reinforcement learning on the edge?](https://towardsdatascience.com/efficient-reinforcement-learning-on-the-edge-331afa979a30). With orthogonal persistence we can implement sequential learning on Edge devices.
* [Exploiting the differences between model training and prediction](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploiting-the-differences-between-model-training-and-prediction-40f087e52923). Reducing the memory footprint and improving the speed and portability of deployed models.
* [MNIST in the browser.](https://towardsdatascience.com/mnist-in-the-browser-f03cc4f055a1). A post explaining how one can use our javascript runtime to run (deep) neural networks directly in the browser.
* [Object recognition on the edge](https://medium.com/@maurits.kaptein/object-recognition-on-the-edge-fc8aaaeb2c53). An article detailing how we build the [object recognition on the edge!](https://www.scailable.net/demo/cifar/) demo.
* [Why would you use WebAssembly to put scikit-learn in the browser?](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-would-you-use-webassembly-to-put-scikit-learn-in-the-browser-77671e8718d6). A very popular article detailing why WebAssembly is a great tool for deploying AI & ML models. Give it a read!
* [Stop training more models, start deploying them](https://towardsdatascience.com/stop-training-more-models-start-deploying-them-using-webassembly-49a3f178569e). An article detailing the challenges when deploying models in healthcare.
* [From model fitting to production in seconds](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-model-fitting-to-production-in-seconds-8e6823d87f5d). The shortage usage example of Scailable we were able to write.

## Tutorials
Out tutorials explain (parts of) our technical stack. They explain our self-service platform, and provide more background into our runtimes. The tutorials are created for those who wish to directly develop using our tools.

* [sclbl-101-getting-started](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/tree/master/sclbl-101-getting-started): A step-by-step explanation of the use of Scailable. This tutorial shows how to sign up for a *beta* account, and how to create a first Scailable endpoint using the `sclblpy` package. 
* [sclbl-create-your-own-wasm](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/tree/master/sclbl-create-your-own-wasm): This tutorial shows how to create your own custom WebAssembly executable using `c` (and the [wasienv](https://medium.com/wasmer/wasienv-wasi-development-workflow-for-humans-1811d9a50345) toolchain) that can be deployed on the Scailable platform.
* [sclbl-using-the-webnode](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/tree/master/sclbl-using-the-webnode): A tutorial that demonstrates how to run a Scailable WebAssembly task either in the browser or in our Scailable cloud - automatic fallback included!
* [sclbl-pytorch-onnx](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/blob/master/sclbl-pytorch-onnx/README.md): A tutorial demonstrating how to convert models fitted using PyTorch to WebAssembly using the Scailable platform and [ONNX](http://onnx.ai).

## Interactive demos
Next to the tutorials presented in this repository, we also have a number of interactive demos:

* [Object recognition on the edge](https://www.scailable.net/demo/cifar/). This demo allows you to recognize object in images directly on the edge (i.e., in your browser). It shows how you can use Scailable to compile complex models to WebAssembly and subsequently how you can use the [`sclbl-webnode`](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-webnode) for super easy deployment.
* [Scailable supports running complex models](https://www.scailable.net/demo/avm/) (such at [Bayesian Additive Regression Trees](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1273584455)) in the cloud, on the edge, or on a browser. Check how we can flexibly generate posterior predictive inferences for automatic property valuation models, anytime, anywhere.
* [Sometimes what you need is performance](https://www.scailable.net/demo/bench/). We provide nothing less. The inferences from our models are extremely fast; check out some of our benchmarks.
* An interactive [MNIST number recognition model](https://www.scailable.net/demo/mnist/). It updates its estimates as fast as you can draw!

## Videos:
Some sample video's of the use of Scailable:

* [Introducing the Scailable platform](https://youtu.be/47wUrjtgFcs). A simple video showcasing the basic functionalities of the Scailable platform.
* [Image classification in the browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m8V-zahU8g). Using PyTorch, ONNX, WebAssembly, and the sclbl-webnode to deploy object recognition directly in the browser. See also [https://www.scailable.net/demo/cifar/](https://www.scailable.net/demo/cifar/).
* [Scailable Webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldhTSQ6K_Co&feature=youtu.be). Webinar explaining the Scailable deployment process to WebAssembly.


## Data Values and Principles:

Scailable is committed to the advancement of AI driven by ethical principles that put people first. To further clarify this position, we make our "Ethical Data Science Manifesto" (building on from the Linux Foundation' s "[Data Values and Principles](https://datapractices.org/manifesto/)") available [here](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-tutorials/blob/master/RESPONSIBLE-AI-MANIFESTO.md). As we acknowledge that this area is dynamic and evolving, we expect to adapt, update and further develop the manifesto as we as we learn over time. 

We also invite our users to check their project(s) against *[deon](https://deon.drivendata.org/)*, an open source command line tool that allows you to easily add an ethics checklist to your data science projects.
